 This package is for people who use Anki as SRS but would like to
 make cards in Org-mode.

 With this package, you can make cards from something like:
 (which is inspired by `org-dirll')

 * Item                     :emacs:lisp:programming:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ANKI_DECK: Computing
   :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
   :END:
 ** Front
    How to hello world in elisp ?
 ** Back
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (message "Hello, world!")
    #+END_SRC

 This package extends Org-mode's built-in HTML backend to generate
 HTML for contents of note fields with specific syntax (e.g. latex)
 translated to Anki style, then save the note to Anki.

 For this package to work, you have to setup these external dependencies:
 - curl
 - AnkiConnect, an Anki addon that runs an HTTP server to expose
                Anki functions as RESTful APIs, see
                https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect#installation
                for installation instructions
