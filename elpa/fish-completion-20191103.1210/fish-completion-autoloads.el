Turn on/off fish shell completion in all future shells or Eshells.

If called interactively, enable Fish-Completion mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called
from Lisp, also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and
toggle it if ARG is `toggle'; disable the mode otherwise.

In `shell', completion is replaced by fish completion.
In `eshell', fish completion is only used when `pcomplete' fails.
