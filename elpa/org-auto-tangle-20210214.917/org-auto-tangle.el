;;; Commentary:

;; It is common to want to tangle org files everytime you save your changes,
;; especially for tangled init files. So this program allows you to
;; do so using #+auto_tangle option in an org file. It also accomplishes 
;; this feat asynchronously so it does not let you Emacs session hang.

;;; Usage:

;; - Add #+auto_tangle: t to your tangled org file
;; - Make changes to the emacs file and save your changes


;;; Code:

(require 'async)
(require 'org)

(defvar org-auto-tangle-default nil
  "Default behavior of org-auto-tangle.

If nil (default), auto-tangle will only happen on buffers with
the `#+auto_tangle: t' keyword. If t, auto-tangle will happen on
all Org buffers unless `#+auto_tangle: nil' is set.")

(defun org-auto-tangle-find-value (buffer)
  "Search the `auto_tangle' property in BUFFER and extracts it when found."
  (with-current-buffer buffer
    (save-restriction
      (widen)
      (save-excursion
	(goto-char (point-min))
	(when (re-search-forward (org-make-options-regexp '("auto_tangle")) nil :noerror)
	  (match-string 2))))))

(defun org-auto-tangle-async (file)
  "Invoke `org-babel-tangle-file' asynchronously on FILE."
